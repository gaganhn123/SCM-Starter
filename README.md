# Smart Contract Management 

This repository contains a Solidity smart contract named Assessment.sol designed to perform mathematical operations based on given formulas. The contract includes functions for subtracting and adding square terms.

## features:
Constructor:

Initializes the contract with an initial balance.
Function 1: getBalance

Retrieves the current balance of the contract.
Function 2: aminusb

Performs the mathematical operation (a*a) + (b*b) - (2*a*b) and updates the contract balance.
Function 3: aplusb

Performs the mathematical operation (a*a) + (b*b) + (2*a*b) and updates the contract balance.ion

## Prerequisites:
Node.js
Solidity Compiler
Metamask wallet

## How to run the program:
Clone Repository
Install Dependencies
Compile Smart Contracts
Test Smart Contract
Monitor and Manage Contract

## Explanation of the Code:

The Solidity smart contract (Assessment.sol) includes functions for initializing the contract, retrieving the balance, and performing mathematical operations.
The React.js frontend interacts with the smart contract using ethers.js and MetaMask.
The useEffect hook ensures that the wallet connection is established on component mount.
The initUser function handles different stages of user interaction, prompting them to install MetaMask, connect their wallet, and displaying account details and balance.
The aminusb and aplusb functions trigger the corresponding smart contract functions and update the displayed balance.

## Usage:
Create a new smart contract using the provided interface or by uploading code.
Test the contract in the designated testing environment.
Deploy the contract to the desired blockchain network.
Monitor the contract's performance and transactions in the analytics dashboard.
